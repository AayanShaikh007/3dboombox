# 3dboombox
This is a interactive 3d boombox that i made for my first project with a-frame. I found it to be pretty similar in structure to other web frameworks such as tailwindcss in that there was trial and error in specifiying where the boxes and items had to go. This project took me around 2 hours to complete. 

# Guide
The website is pretty simple, expect for the fact that you cannot move around it as you can in most other 3d websites, but you can still look around at interact with the 3d elements. Make sure to drag your mouse to select items **with the circular cursor in the center of the page**.
